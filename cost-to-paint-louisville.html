    <h2>Why Henderson Homeowners Are Painting This Year</h2>
    <p>If you live in Henderson, KY, youâ€™ve probably noticed more neighbors freshening up their homes with new paint. 
    Painting is one of the fastest ways to boost curb appeal, increase home value, and make your house feel brand new.</p>

    <h2>Interior vs. Exterior â€” Which Adds More Value?</h2>
    <p>While exterior painting makes the biggest impact on curb appeal, many homeowners in Henderson are also focusing on 
    kitchens, living rooms, and rental units. Interior painting not only makes the home more comfortable but also helps 
    rental properties stand out in the market.</p>

    <h2>Average Painting Costs in Henderson</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interior room:</strong> $250 â€“ $500</li>
      <li><strong>Full exterior (average size home):</strong> $2,000 â€“ $4,000</li>
      <li><strong>Rental refresh:</strong> $800 â€“ $1,500</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These prices vary depending on the size of the home, condition of surfaces, and type of paint used.</p>

    <h2>Why Local Painters Are the Best Choice</h2>
    <p>We recommend hiring Henderson-based painters who know the areaâ€™s climate, humidity, and building styles. 
    Local pros (like my own father-in-law here in Henderson!) take pride in their work and are invested in the community.</p>
